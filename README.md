# Portal rendering impossible space
This is portal rendering for a Marathon clone to render Marathon levels.
I've found an easy way to do 5D space.
Impossible space is 5D space.

You can make your own levels with Weland then export it to a OBJ file and edit the OBJ with blender.
Just copy how the test level works and make a level you like to test the program.
A better way would be to use Forge plus then edit it with blender.

Download the project as a ZIP file then add it to Unity Hub.
After it is loaded, go to Scenes and double click ImpossibleSpace.unity to load the scene.

There still is a bug I have to fix then I can go to adding moving objects.
