# Portal rendering impossible space
This is portal rendering for a Marathon clone to render Marathon levels.
I've found an easy way to do 5D space.
Impossible space is 5D space.

You can make your own levels with Weland then export it to a OBJ file and edit the OBJ with Blender.
Just copy how the test level works and make a level you like to test the program.
Portals.fbx is a 3D remake of Bisqwit's 2D portal rendering tutorial level.

Download the project as a ZIP file then add it to Unity Hub.
After it is loaded, go to Scenes and double click ImpossibleSpace.unity to load the scene.
